# Tektere

Requires ncurses. This repository contains a history of work completed during my time at the Maryland Institute College of Art, and as such is not very _accessible_. The main gist of this work was to experiment with displaying graphics in a TTY terminal using animations build from sequences of custom .psf fonts.
