This is a river that was once travelled.
It is no longer travelled.
Some time ago the river sank into the ground,
all at once.
The water level began sinking rapidly,
but the river continued flowing
even as it was swallowed up by the land.
For many years,
digging in the river bed
unearthed water, right below the surface.
